# CBL Syntax Documentation 

Here is the basic documentation for each CBL (CAPTCHA Breaking Language) command currently available within the scripting language (there is more you can access when using the .NET library directly). 

The plan is to have a programming guide complete with examples and a program structure guide in the near future, but that is dependent on outside forces at the moment. 




##Setup
These are the functions that are placed towards the top of CBL scripts. They set up the methods that will be used to segment and untimately solve the CAPTCHA images.

Method | Description
------ | ------
[ENDPRECONDITIONS](#ENDPRECONDITIONS) | End the preconditioning loop block. 
[SETMODE](#SETMODE) | Set the level of debugger output to the screen when the script is run in a console. 
[SETUPSOLVER](#SETUPSOLVER) | Set up the solver which is responsible for determining what letter an individual picture represents. 
[DEFINEPRECONDITIONS](#DEFINEPRECONDITIONS) | Start the preconditioning loop block ("loop" because it's run for each image being processed). 
[SETUPSEGMENTER](#SETUPSEGMENTER) | Set up the segmenter which is responsible for extracting individual letters from an image after preprocessing. 


##Preprocess
These are the functions that are placed between the *DEFINEPRECONDITIONS* and *ENDPRECONDITIONS* commands. They are run for each image in the set to precondition the image before trying to segment out individual letters.

Method | Description
------ | ------
[RESIZE](#RESIZE) | Resize the image to a specified width and height. 
[ERODE](#ERODE) | Erodes the edges of blobs within an image. 
[GROW](#GROW) | Grow the size of all blobs in the image by one pixel. 
[OUTLINE](#OUTLINE) | Performs a convolutional filter on the image that outlines edges. 
[SUBTRACT](#SUBTRACT) | Perform a pixel-by-pixel subtraction of a given image from the working image and set each pixel value as the difference between the two. 
[MEDIAN](#MEDIAN) | Perform a convolutional median filter on the image. 
[INVERT](#INVERT) | Invert the colors in the image. 
[CROP](#CROP) | Crop the image. 
[BILATERALSMOOTH](#BILATERALSMOOTH) | Performs a bilateral smoothing (edge preserving smoothing) and noise reduction filter on an image. 
[COLORFILLBLOBS](#COLORFILLBLOBS) | Fill each unique blob in an image with a random color. A group of adjacent pixels is considered a single blob when they are all similar to each other in the L`*`a`*`b`*` color space below a given threshold. In the L`*`a`*`b`*` color space, a threshold of 2.3 is considered to be a change "just noticible to the human eye." 
[REMOVESMALLBLOBS](#REMOVESMALLBLOBS) | Remove blobs (by filling them with the background color) from an image that are too small. 
[BLACKANDWHITE](#BLACKANDWHITE) | Convert the image to black and white, where anything not white turns black (even the color #FEFEFE). If you need to choose the threshold yourself, then see BINARIZE. 
[BINARIZE](#BINARIZE) | Convert the image to black and white, where anything above a certain threshold is turned white. 
[REMOVENONCOLOR](#REMOVENONCOLOR) | White out all pixels that are not a color (any shade of grey). (Useful when a CAPTCHA only colors the letters and not the background.) 
[KEEPONLYMAINCOLOR](#KEEPONLYMAINCOLOR) | Finds the color that occurrs most often in the image and removes all other colors that are not the most common color.  This is great if the main CAPTCHA text is all one color and that text always represents the most common color in the image (in which case this function single-handedly segments the letters from the background). 
[SAVESAMPLE](#SAVESAMPLE) | Save a sample of the working image for debugging purposes. This is helpful when writing a script, as you can see every step along the way if you wish. 
[MEANSHIFT](#MEANSHIFT) | Apply a mean shift filter to the image. This will effectively flatten out color groups within a certain tolerance. 
[FILLWHITE](#FILLWHITE) | Fill a color into a region of an image. 
[CONVOLUTE](#CONVOLUTE) | Perform a convolutional filter on the image. 
[HISTOGRAMROTATE](#HISTOGRAMROTATE) | Rotate an image using trial and error until a best angle is found (measured by a vertical histogram).  Use this when an image has slanted letters and you want them to be right side up. 
[WAIT](#WAIT) | Wait for a key press from the user to continue. 


##Working
These are the functions that are used towards the end of CBL scripts. Most of the functions in this group are used temporarily while developing, testing, or measuring the effectiveness of the script.

Method | Description
------ | ------
[TESTSEGMENT](#TESTSEGMENT) | Test the preprocessing and segmentation setup on a test image and save the segmented parts to a folder. 
[TRAIN](#TRAIN) | Train the solver on the patterns acquired or loaded. 
[TEST](#TEST) | Test the solver's ability to produce correct predictions on the patterns acquired or loaded. (Use patterns that were not used in training or you will get skewed results.) 
[FULLTEST](#FULLTEST) | Perform a full test (completely solving a CAPTCHA) and give the actual percentage of CAPTCHAs that were completely and correctly solved. 
[SOLVE](#SOLVE) | Solve a given image using the logic developed and trained for in the CBL script and output the solution. 
[SAVE](#SAVE) | Save the DataBase of trained patterns to a file so that it can be loaded later. The idea is to distribute the database file with your finished script (the finished script shouldn't do any training, only efficient solving). 
[LOAD](#LOAD) | Load a pattern database. The database you load needs to have been saved under the same setup conditions as the script is being loaded under. 
[SAY](#SAY) | Print out a line of debug text to the console. 
[WAIT](#WAIT) | Wait for the user to press a key.

# *Working* Section
These are the functions that are used towards the end of CBL scripts. Most of the functions in this group are used temporarily while developing, testing, or measuring the effectiveness of the script.

----
## FULLTEST
Perform a full test (completely solving a CAPTCHA) and give the actual percentage of CAPTCHAs that were completely and correctly solved. 
This method is only available when running in Training Mode.

### Overload 1
    FULLTEST, Folder, ReportFile

#### Description
Perform a full test (completely solving a CAPTCHA) and give the actual percentage of CAPTCHAs that were completely and correctly solved.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
Folder | Quoted String | The folder that contains a collection of sample CAPTCHA images for testing. The CAPTCHA images need to labeled (named) with the correct solution to CAPTCHA so that there is something to compare the predicted output to and get a percentage correct.
ReportFile | Quoted String | The file to save the report to.



### Overload 2
    FULLTEST, Folder, ReportFile, ImageFilter

#### Description
Perform a full test (completely solving a CAPTCHA) and give the actual percentage of CAPTCHAs that were completely and correctly solved.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
Folder | Quoted String | The folder that contains a collection of sample CAPTCHA images for testing. The CAPTCHA images need to labeled (named) with the correct solution to CAPTCHA so that there is something to compare the predicted output to and get a percentage correct.
ReportFile | Quoted String | The file to save the report to.
ImageFilter | Quoted String | The filter (e.g., *.bmp) to use to find images.


----
## LOAD
Load a pattern database. The database you load needs to have been saved under the same setup conditions as the script is being loaded under. 

### Overload 1
    LOAD

#### Description
Load a pattern database from the default "captcha.db" file.



### Overload 2
    LOAD, Location

#### Description
Load a pattern database from a specified file.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
Location | Quoted String | The name of the pattern database file to load.



### Overload 3
    LOAD, Base64, String

#### Description
Load a pattern database from a base64 representation of the database file.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
*Base64* | *Literal Value* | Load the database file from a base64 encoded string.
String | Quoted String | The Base64 encoded database to load.


----
## SAVE
Save the DataBase of trained patterns to a file so that it can be loaded later. The idea is to distribute the database file with your finished script (the finished script shouldn't do any training, only efficient solving). 
This method is only available when running in Training Mode.

### Overload 1
    SAVE

#### Description
Save the DataBase of trained patterns to the default "captcha.db" file.



### Overload 2
    SAVE, Location

#### Description
Save the DataBase of trained patterns to a given file.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
Location | Quoted String | The file name to save the pattern database to.


----
## SAY
Print out a line of debug text to the console. 

### Overload 1
    SAY, Text

#### Description
Print out a line of debug text to the console.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
Text | Quoted String | The text to print.


----
## SOLVE
Solve a given image using the logic developed and trained for in the CBL script and output the solution. 

### Overload 1
    SOLVE, ImageLocation

#### Description
Solve a CAPTCHA using the logic developed in the current CBL script.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
ImageLocation | Quoted String | The image file to load and solve.



### Overload 2
    SOLVE, %IMAGE%

#### Description
Solve a CAPTCHA using the logic developed in the current CBL script.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
*%IMAGE%* | *Literal Value* | This placeholder will be replaced with the first command line value when run from the command line or, if being run from the CBL-GUI script runner app, will be replaced with the image that was dragged and dropped or loaded by the GUI.


----
## TEST
Test the solver's ability to produce correct predictions on the patterns acquired or loaded. (Use patterns that were not used in training or you will get skewed results.) 
This method is only available when running in Training Mode.

### Overload 1
    TEST, Folder

#### Description
Test the solver's ability to produce correct predictions on the patterns acquired or loaded.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
Folder | Quoted String | The folder that contains the set of labeled patterns to test on. (Use patterns that were not used in training or you will get skewed results.)


----
## TESTSEGMENT
Test the preprocessing and segmentation setup on a test image and save the segmented parts to a folder. 
This method is only available when running in Training Mode.

### Overload 1
    TESTSEGMENT, ImageLocation, OutputFolder

#### Description
Test the preprocessing and segmentation setup on a test image and save the segmented parts to a folder.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
ImageLocation | Quoted String | The location of the image to test the segmentation on.
OutputFolder | Quoted String | The folder to output the segmented test symbols to.


----
## TRAIN
Train the solver on the patterns acquired or loaded. 
This method is only available when running in Training Mode.

### Overload 1
    TRAIN, Folder

#### Description
Start training on a folder of patterns that have already been segmented and labeled for training.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
Folder | Quoted String | The folder that contains the generated testing set of labeled patterns.



### Overload 2
    TRAIN, Folder, Iterations

#### Description
Start training on a folder of patterns that have already been segmented and labeled for training.

#### Parameters
Name | Type | Description
----- | ----- | -----
Folder | Quoted String | The folder that contains the generated testing set of labeled patterns.
